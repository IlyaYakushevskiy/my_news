This is "my Personally filtered news feed", which we made for Project and Seminars course "Python for Engineers" with my team-mates. 

We scraped space-news websites and used a bit of NLP(embeddings pretrained model from HF + cosine similarity) to choose the best articles for our taste and send them to Telegram channel https://t.me/nspcp . 



Organisation : 
We will devide project into
1) scraping websites (probably inspect each website manually,then scrapping "article" data with beautiful soup from html,
 then make a "data sink" in one format)
    > prepapre lists of websites 
2) make filtering : make interface for adding personal filters based on topic of interest, then use smth like open ai embedding model
for sematic search (topic -> data pool)
3) Ship this formated stuff to the bot (define article format)!
